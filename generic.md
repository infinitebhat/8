My name is Gawtam Bhat. I am a graduate of Industrial and Systems Engineering from Univeristy of Florida. 

My belief-"Change is the only constant in any Industry and if we need growth-we need to be agile and flexible to adopt new changes".

I am from a remote village of Southern Indian State Karnataka. My parents are agriculturists, we grow and sell coconuts, arecanuts and Indians spices. I grew up as a very competitive child with tremendous support from my mother who is an educational enthusiast and believes in her statement-'Education is the most powerful thing which can't be taken from us and we can use it to change the world in good ways and help people around us'.

I always loved the concept of business, investments, and growth. Over time, I have discovered my ability to be a people-driven leader - demonstrating confidence and being persistent in results. I have showed my strength in analyzing problems, communicate effectively to arrive at solutions. My experience over time taught me to be agile, flexible and adopt change. I believe in keeping goal, vision and target at work, and in life. I have proven these qualities as a student leader by maintaining highest integrity with Engineering Graduate Council, Indian Graduate Student Association and ISE Graduate Student Organization at University of Florida. 

Lets say, if the problem is about data analysis, demand forecasting, transportation planning and supporting sales and marketing team, or about business growth by new product development, I love the challenge. I believe in dedicated learning and obsessed to finish works I take & do not worry about the time where I spend doing it. I have worked on course projects related to customer Clustering, Demand and Supply forecasting where I worked on time series data, mainly used MS Excel, Minitab to apply exponential smoothing forecast models, Jupyter Notebooks to implement ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, Machine Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks to reduce the variability in future demand predictions. Addition to Time-series data, I have also worked on Transportation planning, Speech Recognition using RNN, Support Vector Machines and KNN algorithms and Economic data analysis of Tech Pulse Index and Stock Market.

I am looking forward to work on interesting problems with challenges to extract insights from data, developing new strategies and to optimize the costs returns and improving performance of existing models using available data. I am currently looking for full time opportunities. If you come across any opportunities which suits my skills, please feel free to contact me.

Skills/interests: Python, R, SQL, Stata, Minitab, Excel, SAP, Tableau, MS Project. 

This website is a medium for me to share my projects and experiences through my Master's journey and beyond.

In my free time, I would like to go for running, play cricket, hiking(I miss hiking! Its been a good amount time), or if I feel like being glued to my laptop, I like to read about the on-going research in Data Science and Supply Chain fileds. I am very shy when it comes to share my pictures and videos, and if interested, you can check out my posts and connect through following.
