"Change is the only constant in any Industry and if we need growth-we need to be agile and flexible to adopt new changes."

My name is Gawtam Bhat. I am a graduate of Industrial Engineering from the University of Florida. Currently pursuing a master's degree in Business Research (Marketing Research) at the School of Business, University of Connecticut.

I was born and raised in a remote village in the Southern Indian State-Karnataka. My parents are agriculture practitioners, who grow and sell agri-products like coconuts, areca nuts, and spices. I grew up as a very competitive child with tremendous support from my mother who is an educational enthusiast and believes in the importance of education; in her own words-"Education is the most powerful thing which can't be taken from us, and we can use it to change the world in good ways and help people around us." Because of her support, I always stood in the top one percentile in academics by showing all-around personality traits in extracurricular activities like Music, Dance, and Cricket. I was also a school leader, and topper of my district at the time (2011, Dakshina Kannada, State: Karnataka )  and received an award (plus INR 20,000) from the Education Ministry of the Karnataka State. In the early days of my college, I found mechanical engineering to be very interesting because of its core engineering applications in day-to-day life, especially in transportation (like cars and bikes) like any other young adventure-loving kid. Later I realized my passion aligns with Industrial engineerings like Data Science, Optimization, and Supply Chain in which I completed my master's studies. Currently, my research interest is in the field of Marketing with a focus on extracting meaningful marketing insights from data, identifying the triggers, and recommending strategies. I have hands-on experience in data mining, cleaning, and analyzing big datasets through academic course projects related to Economics, retail, and voice recordings. You can refer to my work in the Portfolio section.  

I have always loved the concept of business development, investments, sales, and marketing. Over time, I have discovered my ability to be a people-driven leader - demonstrating confidence and being persistent in results. I have shown my strength in analyzing problems, and identifying and communicating effectively to arrive at solutions. My experience over time taught me to be agile, and flexible, and adopt change. I believe in keeping the vision.

I have proven leadership qualities as a student by maintaining the highest integrity with the following organizations: 
1. President - Doctoral Association for Business School, University of Connecticut (2022) 
2. Senator, Graduate Student Senate (2022)
3. Steward - UConn-GEU (2021-2022)
4. Master's Representative to the Engineering Graduate Council, ISE Graduate Student Organization - University of Florida (2020)
5. Vice President - Indian Graduate Student Association, University of Florida (2020)
6. PR Director - Indian Graduate Student Association, University of Florida (2019)
7. President - Internship Cell, Mechanical Engineering Department, Gogte Institute of Technology (2016-2017) 

I look forward to working on exciting problems with challenges to extract insights from data, developing new strategies and optimizing the costs, and improving the performance of existing models using data. 

Skills/interests: 
Python, R, SQL, Stata, Minitab, Excel, SAP, Tableau, MS Project.

Be happy and have a smile on your face for your excellent health.
