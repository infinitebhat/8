My name is Gawtam Bhat. I am a graduate of Industrial and Systems Engineering from the University of Florida. 

My belief-"Change is the only constant in any Industry and if we need growth-we need to be agile and flexible to adopt new changes".

I was born and raised in a remote village of the Southern Indian State-Karnataka. My parents are agriculture practitioners, grow and sell agri-products like coconuts, areca nuts, and spices. I grew up as a very competitive child with tremendous support from my mother who is an educational enthusiast and believes in her statement-'Education is the most powerful thing which can't be taken from us and we can use it to change the world in good ways and help people around us'. Because of her support, I always stood in the top one percentile in academics with showing all-around personality traits in extra curricular activities like Music, Dance and Cricket. I was also a school leader, topper of my district at the time and received award from Education Ministry of the State. In the early days of my college, I found mechanical engineering to be very interesting because of its core engineering applications in day-today life, especially in transportation. Later I realized my passion aligns with Industrial engineering in which I completed my master's studies.   

I always loved the concept of business, investments, and growth. Over time, I have discovered my ability to be a people-driven leader - demonstrating confidence and being persistent in results. I have shown my strength in analyzing problems, communicate effectively to arrive at solutions. My experience over time taught me to be agile, flexible, and adopt change. I believed in keeping the vision and proven leadership qualities as a student by maintaining the highest integrity with the Engineering Graduate Council, Indian Graduate Student Association, and ISE Graduate Student Organization at the University of Florida. 

I love the challenges if it is about supporting business growth by data analysis, demand forecasting, and transportation planning. I believe in dedicated learning and am obsessed to finish the works I take & do not worry about the time where I spend doing it. I have worked on course projects related to customer Clustering, Demand and Supply forecasting where I worked on time series data used MS Excel, Minitab, Python, Stata to apply forecast models. For using python, I used Jupyter notebooks to implement ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, Machine Learning, and Recurrent Neural Networks to reduce the variability in retail demand predictions. In addition to Time-series data, I have also worked on Transportation planning, Speech Recognition using machine learning algorithms, and Economic data analysis of the Tech Pulse Index and Stock Market.

I am looking forward to work on interesting problems with challenges to extract insights from data, developing new strategies and optimize the costs, and improving the performance of existing models using data. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities in Data Science/Supply Chain Management. If you come across any opportunities which suit my skills, please feel free to contact me at infinitebhat@gmail.com.


Skills/interests: Python, R, SQL, Stata, Minitab, Excel, SAP, Tableau, MS Project.
